This is a highly colorful Christian classical art form that originated in \\nGothuruth village, North Paravur. It is noted for its attractive make-up of characters, their elaborate \\ncostumes, detailed gestures and well-defined body movements presented in tune with the rhythmic \\nplayback music and complementary percussion. This art form highly resembles European opera. Chavittu\\nNadakam is believed to have originated during the 16th century AD. This form of play is prevalent among \\nthe Christian community in the districts of Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur.  \\n- Kathakali. Kerala\\'s celebrated classical ballad with use of large costumes and elaborate make-up. It is a \\ndance drama, noted for wide range of characters. Each character has a special kind of costume and \\nmake-up, special movements, particularly extensive expressions, refined gestures, and innovative \\nthemes. The dance is accompanied with anchor music and precise drumming. The Kathakali Music is \\nunique as it varies in accordance to expressions and reactions. Whilst traditional Indian epics, mainly the \\nRamayan and Gita Puran, constitute the main story-boards for the dance drama, many international \\nversions like Shakespearian-Homer-Biblical works are now taken as themes. A glimpse of Kathakali can \\nbe seen in shows organised by various cultural centres across Kerala (including the ones at Thekkady), \\nwhich showcase the art and educate people about it.  \\n- Koodiyattom.  An ancient form of theatre with a legacy of more than 2,000 years. This is very stylised \\nSanskrit theatre and recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of \\nHumanity. Most of the characters are noted for Sanskrit recitations and highly stylised movement, \\nparticularly eye expressions. Some parts of the stories are expressed only using the eyes.  \\n- Margam Kali (Malayalam: \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00). One of the ancient group dances of Kerala practised by Saint Thomas \\nChristians. The Margamkali is a ritual folk dance in which twelve people dance around a traditional oil \\nlamp (Nilavilakku). They represent the 12 apostles, and Christ is represented by the lamp. They perform \\nthe dance wearing the traditional white dhoti and a peacock feather on the turban. Margamkali is \\nessentially famous among the Syrian Christ of Kottayam and Thrissur districts.  \\n- Mohiniyattom. This  classical artform of Kerala is a subtle and graceful dance performed by women in \\ntraditional costume. Most of the themes are poems, unlike other classical dances which have an \\nemphasis on Hindu mythology.  \\n- Theyyam. This is a ritualistic rite performed in the temples of Malabar.  It is an ancient tradition, whereby\\nworship takes the form of performance, rather than formal worship. While dressed in Theyyam costume, \\nperformers are considered Gods and Goddesses. There are nearly 41 various types of Theyyam, each \\nnoted for its different legend and stories. A visit to any Malabar temples during Theyyam season \\n(Dec-Mar) is advised.  \\n  \\nCategory: Culture  \\n- Chavittu Nadakam (Malayalam: \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00).

Some parts of the stories are expressed only using the eyes.  \\n- Margam Kali (Malayalam: \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00). One of the ancient group dances of Kerala practised by Saint Thomas \\nChristians. The Margamkali is a ritual folk dance in which twelve people dance around a traditional oil \\nlamp (Nilavilakku). They represent the 12 apostles, and Christ is represented by the lamp. They perform \\nthe dance wearing the traditional white dhoti and a peacock feather on the turban. Margamkali is \\nessentially famous among the Syrian Christ of Kottayam and Thrissur districts.  \\n- Mohiniyattom. This  classical artform of Kerala is a subtle and graceful dance performed by women in \\ntraditional costume. Most of the themes are poems, unlike other classical dances which have an \\nemphasis on Hindu mythology.  \\n- Theyyam. This is a ritualistic rite performed in the temples of Malabar.  It is an ancient tradition, whereby\\nworship takes the form of performance, rather than formal worship. While dressed in Theyyam costume, performers are considered Gods and Goddesses. There are nearly 41 various types of Theyyam, each \\nnoted for its different legend and stories. A visit to any Malabar temples during Theyyam season \\n(Dec-Mar) is advised.  \\n  \\nCategory: Music  \\n- Melam. This is a percussion ensemble, with several variants differing in the number of percussive \\ninstruments used, as well as the style of playing them. Melam is extremely popular and is mostly used \\nduring temple festivals, when more than six hours of continuous playing is the norm. Melam attracts large \\ncrowds and creates wonderful notes. The Thrissur Pooram has the largest Melam, with more than 300 \\nmusicians in the ensemble.  \\n- Sopanam. Kerala\\'s unique classical music has slow, graceful rhythms. Most of the original versions are \\npoems, and the music is coupled with poetic expression and style. Sopanam is now limited to regular \\nperformances at temple events.  \\n- Mappila songs. This music is associated with the local Muslim community. Traditionally, the songs were \\nperformed in Mappila Malayalam - a mixture of Arabic and Malayalam - and most tell stories of social \\nsystems and customs. Today, Mappila songs are popular amongst youngsters, using Malayalam lyrics. \\nMappila songs have a charm of their own as their tunes sound a mix of the ethos and culture of Kerala as \\nwell as West Asia.  \\n- Poems play a pivotal role in Malayalee music culture. Kerala is extremely well known for its various \\nfamous poetic traditions, and a large number of poems of high literary value. Aksharaslokam (Poem \\nrecitations) is a common sight in many village temple platforms and during festival times, where poets \\nrecites poems and challenge other poets to start their recitation with the phrase, the former has ended his\\nrecitation  \\n- Film Music. As elsewhere in India, film music is extremely popular, and Malayalam songs can be heard \\neverywhere.  \\n  \\nCategory: Martial arts  \\n- Cochin International Airport (COK IATA) is the largest airport in the state, as well as the first Indian \\nairport with operations on solar power, with regular flight connections to most parts of India, of the Middle \\nEast, Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and Maldives.

This place is popular among \\nkitesurfers due to the shallow depth of the sea and a very wide beach. Prices are high, with many \\nrestaurants offering Russian cuisine. Nightlife is vibrant here.  \\n- Palolem beach — southernmost beach in Goa, situated in Canacona taluka. Scenic and quiet with \\nnearby islands. Good eating options. It is becoming pricey (by local standards) and getting a bit crowded, \\nbut still less crowded compared to other popular beaches.  \\n- Patnem beach — small and quiet beach in Canacona Taluka.  \\n- Vagator beach — in Bardez, neighbouring Anjuna. Frequented by Western backpackers and home to \\nraves.  \\n  \\nCategory: Art & culture  \\n- Agonda — also known as Turtle Beach, in the south.  \\n- Anjuna beach — close to the Chapora Fort, its key attraction is a magnificent Albuquerque Mansion built\\nin 1920, flanked by octagonal towers and an attractive Mangalore tile-roof.

This is still part of \"alternative\" Goa, though charter and other tourists also \\nvisit in increasing numbers to \"get a feel of the hippy years\".  \\n- Arambol beach — a quiet beach in North Goa near Pernem.

Also site for a fishing jetty \\nwhere trawlers (introduced into Goa in the 1960s and 1970s, amid protests from traditional fishermen, \\nwho were affected by them) bring in their catch.
